# GriefPreventionPlus
GriefPreventionPlus offers better performances, data integrity, extension capabilities, it currently supports MC1.7.10 and higher (1.8.9, 1.9.4, and 1.10.2 were tested). 

There's a (old) MC1.6.4 version too (thanks to @CappyT and @dedo1911)

[DeVcoFTB](http://www.devcoftb.com)'s servers use this plugin.

## Download
All builds for my plugins can be found on my [personal page](http://mc.kaikk.net/), or under [releases](https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/GriefPreventionPlus/releases).

###Installation
- If you've installed GriefPrevention, remove GriefPrevention jar from plugins folder
- Put GriefPreventionPlus jar into plugins folder

If an existing GriefPrevention database is found, a copy will migrate to GriefPreventionPlus.
Your GriefPrevention database won't be removed: you can rollback to GriefPrevention if you need!

If you're using GriefPrevention file based storage, read this: https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/GriefPreventionPlus/issues/11

###Major features

- Drastically improved database performances and reduced size: bigger servers will notice it!
- Overall performance improvements
- API improvements: all claims and subdivisions have an unique id
- Less waste of resources (RAM)
- You can use the /claim [range] command to claim land around your position!

####Notice
- GriefPrevention's extensions don't work with GriefPreventionPlus without some little change on the code. If needed, I will fork most important GriefPrevention's extension to make it work with GriefPreventionPlus! You can ask for it!
